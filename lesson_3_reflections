When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

> Remote repository is useful when there are multiple contributors to the repository
or multiple users who need to clone this repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

> Automatic synchronization with remote repository would change the state
of your project without your control. For instance, if you have a version of
a software project that currently builds an automatic pull could break the build.
